﻿Peter is a native of Denmark,
﻿With many years of experience in the industry work took him to Indochina approximately 12 years ago. Having since followed the many trails of Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, India, China & Japan - both as an professional and as a explorer, the encounters made him feel a warm glow of humanity that underlines the life within an apparent great diversity,
My Indochina.​
 
After a career with major world tour operators working across cultural borders for more than 15 years, Peter and Vic together founded Indochina Explorers with a vision to give the traveler an option to explore more and experience the fascinating cultures that encompass the joy of life in
﻿Our Indochina.
﻿Since then we have served many travelers living out their Dream Vacation, experiencing new inspiring ways of life or simply just getting a true exotic break from everyday life.
